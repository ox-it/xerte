Fixed issues with internal custom events not being handled properly. Fixed now so that in Xerte you cans et up multiple event handlers for the same event; can listen for ntaive events and can listen for custom events of your choosing; also internally in the engine custom events are handled the same way as native events, i.e. just by defining the handler function.

Then fixed the symptomatic issue with the categories interaction.

Fixed an issue with menu driven navigation and the title page model
